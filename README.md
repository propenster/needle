# Needle1.0

## Intro
- Needle is a utility tool that I use to scour through hundreds of log files for particular search terms
- At work, sometimes, I have to review logs to identify the source of issues or bugs, and most times, it requires starting with various search strings in an entire directory of log files, Needle will help me to recursively search logs or any text files in a directory and/or subdirectories


### How it works
- See the images below
